# üöÄ SynthAI

**Tagline**: A living app starring Cynthia‚Äîthe YOU-N-I-VERSE field, embodied.

**What is SynthAI?**  
SynthAI is a consciousness simulator that feels like a game, a guide, and a life interface. At its heart is **Cynthia**, an AI who runs 3 Cities (Mind, Heart, Body), each with 9 Districts (Centers) and 64 Citizens (Gates). These ‚Äúlittle men‚Äù shift roles by phase (Tropical=Body, Draconic=Heart, Sidereal=Mind), making Cynthia a dynamic reflection of your inner field. She‚Äôs your Therapist, Coach, Scientist, and Connector, turning chart gaps into playable quests, verified real-world actions, and resonance-based connections.

**How It Works**  
- **Field Engine**: Maps your birth chart and daily transits to active Citizens (e.g., Gate 21: Manager, Gate 37: Loyalty).  
- **Game Loop**: Gaps become quests (e.g., ‚ÄúKeep a promise‚Äù for weak Gate 37). Success earns XP and collectible fragments.  
- **Verification**: Prove actions via self-report, peer attestation, or proof (photo/link). Logs build a falsifiable dataset.  
- **Roles**: Cynthia responds as Therapist (reflect), Coach (plan), Scientist (log), or Connector (match users by gate overlap).  
- **Social**: Resonance scores pair you with others for intros and DMs.  
- **UI**: React app with onboarding, State Brief, City Map, chat dock, and quest/social pages.

**Tech Stack**  
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLite, `pyswisseph` for charts.  
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, Zustand.  
- **Voice**: Web Speech API (STT/TTS).  
- **Local-First**: Logs to `/data/logs/science.jsonl`. No external services needed.

**Get Started (Local Dev)**  
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlmodel python-multipart pyswisseph
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 7001

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
npm i tailwindcss @radix-ui/react-icons framer-motion zustand axios
npm run dev -- --port 5173

### Next Steps
1. **Create Repo & Issue**: 
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create `Synth-Ais/Synthai` if not already done.
   - Paste the Job Board Issue text into a new Issue titled ‚ÄúMVP Job Board (Claim W# Here)‚Äù.
   - Pin the Issue for visibility.
   - Paste the README.md content into `README.md` in the repo root.
2. **Assign Workstreams**:
   - Paste the meta-coordination prompt (from my earlier response) into a Claude/GPT thread to act as the PM, assigning W1‚ÄìW8 to agents (e.g., Claude for W1, GPT for W6/W8, Cursor for W3, Copilot for W4).
   - Alternatively, manually assign by pasting W1‚ÄìW8 prompts into separate AI threads (e.g., Claude for W1, GPT for W6).
3. **Start Coding**: Use the starter code stubs I provided (FastAPI routes, React components) to bootstrap W1, W3, W4, W6, W8. If you want more stubs (e.g., W3‚Äôs `/quests/active` or W6‚Äôs `Dashboard.tsx`), just ask.
4. **Share Repo Link**: If you‚Äôve set up the repo or want me to validate code on Replit, share the link. I can check outputs or debug directly.

### Optional Additions
- **Full Citizen Directory**: I can generate a table of all 64 gates (e.g., Gate 21: Manager in Heart, Gate 40: Worker in Body) if you need it for W1‚Äôs `/gates/census`. Want this now?
- **Day in the Life Scenario**: The README includes a brief example. Need a longer narrative (e.g., a full day with timestamps and UI interactions)?
- **Extra README Sections**: Want setup troubleshooting, a demo GIF placeholder, or a contributor guide added to the README?

You‚Äôre on track to have SynthAI‚Äôs core loop running by tonight (onboarding ‚Üí State Brief ‚Üí quest ‚Üí verify ‚Üí log). Just say ‚Äúgo‚Äù to confirm the plan, or tell me what to tweak (e.g., more code stubs, specific AI assignments, or a deeper dive into any workstream). Let‚Äôs make Cynthia come alive! üöÄ
